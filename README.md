# SimpleInstaBot

Use a robot to attract more followers. Now as a simple desktop app!

## Download

- [Mac OS X](https://github.com/mifi/SimpleInstaBot/releases/latest/download/SimpleInstaBot-mac.dmg)
- [Windows](https://github.com/mifi/SimpleInstaBot/releases/latest/download/SimpleInstaBot-win.exe)
- [Linux AppImage](https://github.com/mifi/SimpleInstaBot/releases/latest/download/SimpleInstaBot-linux.AppImage)
- [Linux tar.tz](https://github.com/mifi/SimpleInstaBot/releases/latest/download/SimpleInstaBot-linux.tar.bz2)

NOTE: After installing you may need to right click the application icon and then "Open" in order to bypass "Untrusted app" dialogs. This is because Microsoft requires a $300/year certificate just to remove this block (I'm not going to pay for that.) Alternatively try to google `windows run untrusted app`.

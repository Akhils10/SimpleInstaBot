# SimpleInstaBot ðŸ¤–

Use a robot to attract more followers. Now as a simple desktop app!

![Demo](https://github.com/mifi/SimpleInstaBot/raw/master/screenshot.jpg)

## How does it work?

It runs as a desktop application on your computer and will every day follow up to 150 users (configurable) who are following some users whose market you want to target. Then after 5 days (also configurable), it will unfollow these users.

## Features

What makes it different from other bots?

- Simple, easy to use (focuses on one core technique of follow/unfollow)
- Free and open source
- Runs on your own computer, to reduce the risk of being banned. Instagram is known to crack down on cloud and VPN IPs as well as paid Instagram bot services
- Built for all major desktop platforms
- Built on [instauto](https://github.com/mifi/instauto) which has been working for over 2 years
- Automatic rate limiting
- Uses a normal browser to mimic the behavior of a normal user (does not use private APIs)
- Randomized timed behavior
- Simulates human behavior of sleeping at night, and usage in the day time

## Download

NOTE: After installing you may need to bypass "Untrusted app" dialogs. This is because Microsoft requires a costly certificate to remove this block (I'm not going to pay for that.) Alternatively try to google `windows run untrusted app`.

## A word of warning

Many people are getting Action Blocked these days with this bot as well as other bots (it seems even people just following strangers.) Instagram is tightening their rules by not allowing promiscuous behavior like following and liking strangers' photos as much as before, and imposing temp blocks when they think you crossed the limit.

**You use this app at your own risk! I have had great success with this app but I am not responsible for any consequences it may have for your Instagram account.**

## Tips to avoid ban

I advised you to follow these guidelines:
- Run the bot on the same internet connection (WiFi) as you normally use your phone with the instagram mobile app. It will reduce the chance of being flagged
- Use conservative parameters (max follows/unfollows per day 150 and max 20 per hour, maybe even start out lower, and work your way up)

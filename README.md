# SimpleInstaBot ðŸ¤–

Use a robot to attract more followers. Now as a simple desktop app!

![Demo](https://github.com/mifi/SimpleInstaBot/raw/master/screenshot.jpg)

## How does it work?

It runs as a desktop application on your computer and will every day follow up to 300 users (configurable) who are following some users whose market you want to target. Then after 5 days (also configurable), it will unfollow the users.

## Features

What makes it different from other bots?

- Easy to use
- Free and open source
- Runs on your own computer, to reduce the risk of being banned. Instagram is known to crack down on cloud and VPN IPs
- Built for all major desktop platforms
- Built on [instauto](https://github.com/mifi/instauto) which is proven to work and has not triggered a ban for 2 years
- Automatic rate limiting
- Configurable

## Download

- [Mac OS X](https://github.com/mifi/SimpleInstaBot/releases/latest/download/SimpleInstaBot-mac.dmg)
- [Windows](https://github.com/mifi/SimpleInstaBot/releases/latest/download/SimpleInstaBot-win.exe)
- [Linux AppImage](https://github.com/mifi/SimpleInstaBot/releases/latest/download/SimpleInstaBot-linux.AppImage)
- [Linux tar.tz](https://github.com/mifi/SimpleInstaBot/releases/latest/download/SimpleInstaBot-linux.tar.bz2)

NOTE: After installing you may need to right click the application icon and then "Open" in order to bypass "Untrusted app" dialogs. This is because Microsoft requires a $300/year certificate just to remove this block (I'm not going to pay for that.) Alternatively try to google `windows run untrusted app`.

## Known issues

- Be sure to set your instagram language to english
- Many people are getting Action Blocked these days with this bot as well as other bots (it seems even people just following strangers.) Instagram is tightening their rules by not allowing promiscuous behavior like following and liking strangers' photos anymore, and imposing temp blocks when they think you crossed the limit.
